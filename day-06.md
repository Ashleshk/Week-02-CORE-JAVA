# UNIT TESTING
1. defination
    * is a method by which individual units of source code area tested to determine if they are fit for use
    * concerned with functional correctness and completeness of individual program units
    * its goal is to isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correct.
    * typically written and run by software developers to ensure that code meets its design and behaves as intended.

2. Types of Testing
* **black box testing** - outer boundary, application interface, internal module interface and i/o description. 
* **white box testing** - how functions executed and checked each other
* **grey box testing** - test cases, risks assessment ans test methods

3. Traditional Testing
* test the whole program
    * print statement 
    * use og debugger
    * debugger expressions
    * test scripts - web application

4. Unit testing
    * each part testd individaualaly
    * all componenets tested atleast once
    * errors picked up earlier
    * scope is smaller, easier to fix errors

5. UNit testing Ideals
    * isolatable 
    * reapeatable
    * automatable
    * easy to write

6. why need unit test?
    * Better Design
    * faster debugging
    * faster development
    * excellent regression Tool
    * Reduce future Cost
